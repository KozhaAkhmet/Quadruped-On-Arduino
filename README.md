# Quadrupedal Robot on Arduino with RC

Started in November 2020.

This is my first robotics project. Main purpose was to study and make the robot that can walk and controlled remotely. Due to, I did It from scratch. It uses RC communication and recieves It from my [RC controller](https://github.com/KozhaAkhmet/RC-Controller).

I did only one record. I pulished It on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kozha-akhmet-abdramanov-891144197_arduino-selfmade-quadruped-activity-6774464412280487936-j17C?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web).
